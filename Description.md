#Navigating/Negotiating the Night
##Programming
Computer programming was highly integral in the process of constructing “Navigating/Negotiating the Night”. Three tools were essential to this process: C-Sharp Programming Language, Max Visual Programming Language, and the Unity Game Engine. 
###Max Programming Language
The main use of the Max programming language came in the way of abstractly constructing and synchronising the performance’s accumulating audio sequences in coordination to the user's’ tekton actions; the language’s visual interface allowed for innovative and seamlessly elegant audio sequences to be made.

###C# and Unity
C-Sharp Programming Language and the Unity Game Engine were both used simultaneously in order to create transformations and render animations for live performance. Animation scripts were constructed in order to mathematically transform the objects’ topologies into other shapes. This process involved disassembling each of the virtual performance environment’s objects into point clouds, wherein each point is characterised by a vector in three dimensional cartesian space with respect to the centre of the object. This iterative deconstruction allowed for individualised manipulation of each point in order to apply the mathematical topology transformations. Once each of the object’s points have been manipulated, all of the points new positions are collectively taken into account and applied at each animation step. This process is repeated for each subsequent animation step of the live performance.
