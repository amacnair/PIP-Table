Script: 	ProximityTrigger

Author: 	Alex MacNair

Function:	Detects an object's proximity to another predefined object.
			This script is only capable of checking the distance between 
			two specific objects. 

Usage: 		This script should be applied to one object, and a second object
			should be set in the object's Inspector pane for this script.
			Script will trigger when within the range: minDist <= dist <= maxDist

	public Transform other; //Second object to look for

	private float objDist; //Variable to store the distance between the two objects
